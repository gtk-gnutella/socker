2006-08-02 socker 1.4 released

 * Support for PF_LOCAL respectively PF_UNIX has been removed for now
   because its support was incomplete and is most-likely uninteresting.
 * Use HAVE_IPV6_SUPPORT for preprocessor checks instead AF_INET6 etc., so
   that IPv6 support is really disabled if requested for IPv6-capable hosts.
 * src/lib/socker.c:
   * Fixed a file descriptor leak which occurs when fork() fails.
   * Added cmsg_next_header() to suppress unnecessary compiler warnings
     on Linux (glibc).
 * src/main.c:
   * Always enable SO_REUSEADDR for SOCK_STREAM IPv4/IPv6 sockets, so that
     socket() does not fail if an application is frequently restarted.
   * Always enable IPv6-only for IPv6 sockets. This is safer and enforces
     a more portable handling of IPv4/IPv6 mixes since IPv4 over IPv6 sockets
     is not supported everywhere.
 * src/lib/debug.h:
   * Use CHECK_FMT() to prevent/discover format string issues.

2006-04-19 socker 1.3 released

 * config.sh:
   * Added arguments --prefix, --bin-dir, --library-dir, --header-dir for
     more flexibility with hierarchy conventions.
   * Look for whether the compiler knows "__inline".
   * Check whether bind() uses "struct sockaddr *" for the second parameter.
     because the wrapper has to provide a compatible prototype.
   * Check whether the linker uses -rpath or -R to set the runtime library
     path.

 * src/main.c:
   * Fixed typo which caused a compile failure for platforms with
     msg_accrights instead of msg_control.

 * src/lib/socker/main.c:
   * Removed bogus label which caused a compile failure for platforms with
     msg_accrights instead of msg_control.

 * src/lib/wrapper.c:
   * Fixed compile issue for platforms which have a different prototype
     for bind() that is "const void *" vs. "const struct sockaddr *".

 * src/lib/common.h:
   * Define "include" if the compiler does not provide it.

 * src/Makefile.template:
   * Removed unnecessary "LINK.c" because some make implementations
     don't seem to like dots in variable names.

2006-04-14 socker 1.2 released

 * Added wrapper.c and libsocker_wrap.so which allow wrapping the functions
   socket() and bind() using LD_PRELOAD to provide support for socker to
   applications which have no native support for it.

 * Added socker-config to be used by configuration scripts querying the
   compiler flags to compile with socker support.

 * src/main.c
   * Moved optional static configuration to static-config.h.
   * Use syslog() instead of printing to stderr when SOCKER_DEBUG is defined.
   * unescape_token(): Removed unneccessary duplicate check for "quoted".
   * separate_token():
     * Allow NUL as terminating character as well.
     * Move the endptr to the start of the next token instead of the
     nuked separator unless the end of the string has been reached.
   * Added get_token() to reduce duplicate code.
   * address_matches(): An empty address token matches socket-only requests.
   * port_matches(): An empty port token matches socket-only requests.
   * entry_matches(): Separated code into smaller functions for readability.
   * main(): Added parameter "-b" to request a bind-only operation. In this
     case the given file descriptor is not used to transfer a newly created
     socket(). Instead bind() is applied to this file descriptor. This
     requires a matching entry with "protocol" as wildcard because this
     property cannot be determined from the file descriptor. This function
     is mainly for the wrapper library as applications will first call
     socket() and then bind() instead of calling socker_get().
 * src/lib/socker.c
   * Use syslog() instead of printing to stderr when SOCKER_DEBUG is defined.

     
2006-02-20 socker 1.1 released

 * src/lib/socker.c:
   * socket_domain_to_string():
     * Fixed compile issue for environments without IPv6 support.

   * socker_get():
     * Added special case "port == (unsigned) -1" which means
       unspecified port number.

 * src/main.c:
   * parse_socket_domain():
     * Recognize PF_UNIX.
     * Use case-insensitive comparision.
     * Allow to omit the PF_ prefix.

   * parse_socket_type():
     * Use case-insensitive comparision.
     * Allow to omit the SOCK_ prefix.

   * unescape_token(), separate_token():
     * Allow escaping using quotes.
     
   * address_matches():
     * Disallow the wildcard as address for PF_UNIX resp. PF_LOCAL.
     * Allow a CIDR netmask for PF_INET and PF_INET6.

   * entry_matches():
     * Allow addr == NULL if bind() is not desired.

   * socket_granted():
     * Use open() with O_NOCTTY, O_NOFOLLOW, O_NONBLOCK as far as available
       followed by fdopen() for opening the configuration file. The
       configuration file must be trustworthy anyway but this cannot hurt.

   * main():
     * Allow a missing address parameter so that non-bound sockets can
       be acquired.
     * Fixed typo in debug message AF_INET -> AF_INET6.
